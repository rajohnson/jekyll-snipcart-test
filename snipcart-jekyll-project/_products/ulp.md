- Output: 2,000 or 5,000 ppm

The ULP is the sleek new member of the AirSense HVAC CO<sub>2</sub> sensor family. Rising only about a quarter inch from the wall, it discreetly blends-into any architectural motif. But don’t be fooled by its slim profile: inside is a powerhouse of modern sensor technology. The compact dual-beam detection system ensures accurate operation without the need for a “self calibration” algorithm and its attendant operational limitations. The ULP can be used with any building occupancy profile! The ULP mounts conveniently in a standard single-gang junction box.
 
The labeled and pluggable connector makes wiring quick and easy. All screw terminal connections can be made beforehand. And thanks to built-in circuit protection, the ULP will not be damaged even if it is miswired during installation. Just set the slider switch to select the desired output (0-5V, 0-10V, or 4-20mA) and plug-in the connector. There are no jumpers to lose or complicated documentation to decipher. LEDs are provided to indicate CO<sub>2</sub> concentration levels (sometimes required for LEED certification), but they can be disabled to make the ULP even more discreet when necessary.
